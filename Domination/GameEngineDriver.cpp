//// Driver goals:
//// (Part 1: Game start)
//// 1) Show different valid maps can be loaded and their validity is verified(i.e.it is a connected graph, etc), 
////    and invalid maps are gracefully rejected
//// 2) Show that the right number of players is created, a deck with the right number of cards is created.
//// (Part 2: Gameplay: Startup phase)
//// 3) Show all countries in the map have been assigned to one and only one player
//// 4) Show all players have eventually placed the right number of armies on their own countries after army placement is over.
//
//// Goal 1) can be tested by trying to loading valid or invalid maps included in the maps folder.
//// Goal 2), 3) and 4) can be tested through the default constructor's various outputs.
